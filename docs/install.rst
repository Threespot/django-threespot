Installing django-threespot
----------------------------

To install, simply place the ``django_threespot`` directory somewhere on your
``PYTHONPATH``. Some of the components in ``django-threespot`` are Django apps, so you will need to add them to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` to use them (e.g. ``threespot.documentation``).
